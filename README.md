This is version of PL/Java is modified by Greenplum.

It is based on PL/Java 1.5.0 forked from:
    https://github.com/tada/pljava/tree/V1_5_0

To generate the new release for enterprise PL/Java, version should follow 1.4.x for gpdb5+ and 1.3.x for gpdb4.

Note that except adding a new git tag, you also need to bump the version in release.mk
